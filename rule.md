Guidelines: We require TDD and a strong emphasis on code quality. To achieve this, we should prioritize the following principles:

1. The code must be easily readable, with a clear and intuitive folder structure and content.
2. The implementation should be as simple as possible.
3. The code should follow functional programming practices.
4. The code should adhere to common software-quality principles such as SOLID, DRY, and KISS, among others.
